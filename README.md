# MEAN Auth App

Following [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) on his 10 part course, I've decided to enhance my previous knowledge, and gain a fundamental understanding of AngularJS as well, following the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.JS, AngularJS and NodeJS) approach.

The project will turn out to be a simple Authentication Application for Users to register and login to their profile.
